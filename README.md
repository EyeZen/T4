# T4 (Timed Tick-Tack-Toe ðŸ˜…)
Welcome to Timed Tic Tac Toe! This game adds an exciting twist to the classic game:

## Game Rules

- Players take turns placing X's and O's on the board
- Each move has a timer - when it expires, that move disappears!
- The oldest move of each player will disappear when its timer runs out
- Win by getting three in a row before your moves expire
- You can adjust the move timer duration in Settings

I have neither come up with the game nor coded it. I just saw it on youtube and got the stackblitz' bolt.new ai to generate it for me!
